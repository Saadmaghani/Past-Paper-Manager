# Past-Paper-Manager
I created this google app script to help me keep track of all the past papers I did for my A and O Level examinations.

It was able to create a colour coded table with a subject name, the types of papers, its variants and how many years you wanted to achieve. 

Upon completing a paper you would simply write "done" or something like writing the date you completed your paper on in the proper cell. You could also use the script to set the "done" or date for you if you're too lazy to find the cell.

The program could then generate reports of how many papers you have done of a particular subject or a particular type of paper, or a particular variant of a paper, or within these years.
